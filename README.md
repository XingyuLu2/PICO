This contains the implementation of the PICO algorithm.

Download it and run it as Python programs.

How to run the program:
1. to run the PICO algorithm and get the communication volume with different number of clients [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60], compile the "run_PICO.sh" and run as:
'''
chmod +x run_PICO.sh
./run_PICO.sh
'''

1. to run the COPML as benchmark and get the communication volume with different number of clients [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60], compile the "run_PICO.sh" and run as:
'''
chmod +x run_PCOPML.sh
./run_COPML.sh
